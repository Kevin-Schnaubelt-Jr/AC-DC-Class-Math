    It's no secret that we speak differently to different people. Tailoring the way we
    speak to our audience is something we develop naturally. One of the ways that we do this that I've noticed, 
    and that isn't often discussed, is via pitch. A higher tone of voice is seen as more agreeable and is
    usually what people use in public or professional settings. And on the other side of the spectrum, a deeper tone
    can conveys more authority. Personally I try to be cognizant of my pitch in all of my interactions.

Inside jokes among friends can get pretty intricate as time goes on. 
I know me and my friend can have full blown conversations that no outsiders would be able to understand.Â
