list of them

1) Constant function f(x)=k, where k is a number.
on a graph it's just horizontal. y=k. Cross the y at k, so the y intercept is (0,k)

Properties of constant:
symmetrical to the y axis. which make sit EVEN. Constant on (-oo,oo). y intercept is (o,k)
domain: (-oo,oo)
range: k



2) Identity function - is a slanted line f(x)=x. Whatever input you give it matches the output.
Slanted line "/" because the input (x) is the same at output (y). so (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
Domain: (-oo,oo)
Range: (-oo,oo)
symmetric to origins, so it's ODD.
y intercept is (0,0)
It's also increasing.



3) Square Function - f(x)=x**2 - So whatever the input is, the output will be input squared.
def function(x):
    return x**2

The graph is an upward parabola "U"
Domain: (-oo,oo)
Range: y >= 0 or [0,oo)
It's symmetrical to the y-axis, so it's EVEN.
It's also decreasing from (-oo,0) and increasing from (0,oo)



4) Cube Function f(x)=x**3 - You can have negative output functions unlike the squared one.
The graph looks like a origin symmetrical line 
"  |
"  /
"----
" /
"|

Domain: (-oo,oo)
Range: (-oo,oo)
Origin symmetry to ODD
y-intercepts (0,0)
It's increasing (-oo,oo)



5) Square Root Function f(x)=sqrt(x) - returns a FLOAT
Graph is a long going right from (0,0)
Domain: [0,oo]
Range: [0,oo]
y intercept is (0,0)
Not EVEN OR ODD
Increasing [0,oo]



6) Cube Root f(x) = cube root so cbrt(x).
Domain and range (-oo,oo)
ODD
y intercept is (0,0)
increasing on (-oo,oo)
print(cbrt(8))
