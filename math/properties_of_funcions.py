vertical "VERTICAL" line test. see if graph is a function

VERTICAL line that intersects once is a function. 
more than once, not a function

'''
domain, range, intercepts from graph
domain is all the points in between and including that farthest x-axis points.
the range is all the points in between and including the farthest y-axis points
just the points with 0 for x or y.

with arrows, things are different. since arrows pointing down south west and south east, all x values are -oo to oo.
so domain is (-oo,oo)
for the range, since the arrows are only pointing down, it's (-oo, highest y point]
