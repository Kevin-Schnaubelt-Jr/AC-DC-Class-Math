Rational function is a fraction where the top and bottom are polynomials.
Graphs look similar to 

dashy line up, dashy line down, and then 2 exponential lines mirrored across "origins"
There's both a vertical and horizontal asymptote.

for the vertical "VA":
so for example x = 7, as x approaches 7 from the RIGHT, f(x) goes to oo.
as x approaching 7 from the LEFT f(x) goes to -oo

for the horizontal "HA":
so for y = 5
as x goes forever to the left, f(x) approaches 5.
