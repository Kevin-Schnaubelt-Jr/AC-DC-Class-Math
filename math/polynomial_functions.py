some examples of polynomial_functions are:
f(x) = 2*x**2 + x - 2
g(x) = (1/2)*x**3 - x
h(x) = sqrt(2*x**4) - 2*x**4 + 1

all of these consist of terms such as 2*x**2 and their separated by a + or -.
They all have some variable x. 
Exponents for the variables are positive whole numbers.
coefficients are stuff attached to the X. So for 1, x  has a coefficient of 2, and the second x has a coefficient of 1. The -2 on its own
is the constant.

The graphs look generally like smooth and continuous curves.
like a parabola or a sine wave. peaks are round, unlike absolute value graphs, which are like "V".

standard form
f(x) = a_n*x**n  + ... + a_2*x**2 + a_1*x + a_0
a_n subscript of n a_n*x**h is the nth term.
all the a's are just numbers.
a_n x**h is the leading term (has the highest exponent for x) a_n is leading coefficient.

so for f(x) = 2*x**2 + x - 2:
the leading term is 2*x**2
the leading coefficient is 2
and the constant term is -2.
the degree is the highest exponent, which is 2 in this case.
'''

'''
example: y = 2 - x**5 + x
lets rewrite it
y = -x**5 + x + 2
now we can see it's a polynomial.
the leading term is -x**5
the constant term is 2
and the degree is 5
'''

'''
example 2:
f(x) = x**(5/2) - x**4 + 4
this is NOT a polynomial because it has an exponent that isn't a positive whole number.
the variable can also not be in the denominator. 
'''

'''
example 3:
y = (9 - x**4) / 4
you can rewrite this into standard form by doing ((-x**4) / 4) + (9/4)
the leading term is -x**4/4
constant 9/4

a poly graph looks like a snap. "U^".
it has 3 intercepts. (zeros)
degree: 3, which matches the x intercepts usually.
the degree tells us the max numbers of x intercepts, or zeros.

so for 3 points, -6, -1, 7. or (-6,0), (-1,0), (7,0)

The leading term is going to trump all over terms in how it's graphed.
in particular it will resemble a_n*x**n
f(x) = 3*x**2 - x + 1
the leading term, 3*x**2, is going to be a parabola "U".
2 is the degree, meaning the max numbers of zeros is 2.
'''

'''
zeros of polynomial

example:
f(x) = 2*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 2*x - 5
determine eif x-1 is a factor. If it is, that means x=1 is a zero.
so if we plug 1 into the function to see if the output is zero.
it's 2, so x is NOT a factor.
'''

'''
example 2:
f(x) = 2*x**4 - 4*x**3 - 4*x + 6
so divide by x-1, which is x=1
so plug 1 into the function, and we get 0, so it is a factor.
'''

'''
Descartes's rule of sign.
f(x) = 6*x**7 + x**3 - x**2 + 5
degree of 7.  ^------^ sign change.
also - x**2 + 5 is another sign change.
so 2 sign changes, so we expect either 2 or 2 less numbers (0) of positives zeros.

for negative zeros, but in (-x) in to the function.

y = 6*x**6 - 4*x**2 - x + 7
6 is the degree, so the max numbers of zeros is 6.
6 to -6 is a sign change, then a -x to + 7 is a sign change, so 2 sign changes.
so 2 or no positive zeros.
how many negative zeros? plug in -x. there's 2 sign changes in there, so 2 or zero negative zeros.
'''

'''
Potential rational zeroes
f(x) = a_n*x**n + ... + a_0

factors of a_0
--------------
factors of a_n

focus on constant term on leading coefficient.

eliminate any duplicates 
f(x) = 3*x**4 - 5*x**3 + x**2 - x + 1
