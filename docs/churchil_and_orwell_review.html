    <h1 class="head">Opening Paragraph</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;This is a review of "George and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom" by Thomas E. Ricks. Going into this assignment, 
        I only know a handful of things about either historical figure. Churchill was of course the leader of Britain during World War II, and
        although not necessarily unpopular, he lost his reelection following the war. George Orwell is of course 
        famous for his social science fiction dystopia "1984" and his political satire "Animal Farm.". Aside from those popularly understood things
        about these two historical figures, that's all that I know. But, that's why I've chosen this book for review, and I'm very exited to learn
        the details about these two incredibly influential people.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">1A. How interesting to read was the authors writing style. (I guess this needs to be two paragraphs?)</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;I've just finished the book, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. I was definitely more interested in Orwell at the outset, but after
        learning so much about Churchill, I'm definitely finding myself a fan of both figures. The book is definitely a page turner, partly because of 
        the subject matter is the explosive final chapter of the 20th century that set ups our current way of life and thinking, but mostly because the 
        narrative tells a good story; that being the second world war from Churchill and Orwell's perspective. One of my favorite aspects of the book 
        are the general overviews and reviews of "Animal Farm," "1984," and Churchill's Memoirs. It's not that I don't feel the need to read these now,
        I'll probably only realistically read "Animal Farm," but it was nice to have them comprehensively explained. In fact, each one almost gets it's own
        chapter. If I do end up reading Churchill's memoirs, I'm glad I'll have the author's forewarning on it's nature, mainly that the first two 
        chapters are the best and that it starts to fall off after that, explaining that it was written by a committee along with Churchill and that Churchill
        lost interested in it after.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">1B. How easy to understand was the authors writing?</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The author mentions an essay by Orwell in 1945 titled "Politics and the English Language"
        where, in it, Orwell offers six rules for writing. I don't think I understand them well enough to practice them myself, but after the author mentions the rules, 
        I noticed that he was following them and had been following them the whole time. It's clear that the author took this essay to heart and as such the book 
        is extremely enjoyable to read and easy to understand. There's a very funny part of the book where he quotes a book written by John Rodden about George Orwell. The sentence is 
        terrible and almost impossible to understand. It goes something like, "Typically the watchword is the point of departure for the evolution of variants, but the variants 
        may also serve as the basis for establishing the primary watchword." I'm very glad "Churchill and Orwell" was not written like this.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">1C. How was the book generally structured?</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book was paced very well. The author goes back and forth on Churchill and Orwell, generally focusing on one for a chapter and then the other. The first chapters are
        briefly about their early careers and politics, followed by a chapter for each that ends right before the second world world. Both chapters ending in 
        eerie prophesy predicting the impending war. Each one of those two chapters is so engrossing, and ends on such a prophetic cliffhanger, that the transition to the 
        other historical figure in the following chapter is almost disappointing. I say almost, as the following chapter has equal appeal and ramps the tension just as much. 
        This eventually leads to a big payoff in the middle of the book. The closing chapters of the book are very similar to the closing chapters in either figure's lives. The big 
        battle was over, and now that both figures could see victory the world that they would survive in was a little darker then they had time to imagine before. Both Churchill and Orwell
        where in a very dark and dreary time in their lives, and the tone of the book reflects that. The book ends with the lasting legacy of the two, and how each figure becomes 
        more and more deified as time goes one. The overall pacing reminds me of how the author describes Churchill's memoirs. The beginning is excellent, the middle is more practical and
        not as bombastic, and then it ends with a big pop. The big pop in Churchill's memoirs being his account of the Normandy Landings. "Churchill and Orwell" would thankfully
        stop with a pop, unlike the memoirs.

    <h1 class="head">2A. explain the main themes</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;So why compare Churchill and Orwell? Both men certainly where anti totalitarianism, but how much more similarity could there be? Well, as it turns out, quote a lot. Both had poor 
        relationships with their fathers, both came of age in remote parts of the British Empire, both where writers, and both had near death experiences that should have absolutely left them dead and the world 
        completely unrecognizable as a result. Overall the most similar feature is that these two men would be the absolute greatest figures
        of the 20th centaury when it came to predicting and resisting the future of human total authority. The 20th century absolutely needed them both. In the case of Churchill, there 
        was no one else set up to take the stand for Britain after Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, showing that appeasement clearly had done nothing. Other British leaders, such as Lord Halifax, would 
        have likely betrayed the country and capitulated to Hitler. In the case of Orwell, he gave us clear insight into the rhetoric and abuses of power by the left and have us language to understand it, such as 
        phrases like "double speak," and "memory hole."

    <h1 class="head">2B. Explain how well the author supported the book's main themes.</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;But as much as totalitarianism is evil, the truth at the root of problem according to the book is, in fact, truth itself. Before even talking about the state rewriting history in 1984, the author
        constantly mentions how both Churchill and Orwell were fact focused characters. The author would often show instances of Churchill not taking anything for granted and doing his own fact finding. 
        The book mentions an exchange with one of Churchill's admiralty, Admiral Cunningham, in which Cunningham doubts the success of a mission he carried out at Churchill's request, stating that 
        while the 5 day mission was a success with no casualties, a "heavy flight squadron working from Egypt could probably carry out in a few hours." Churchill would fire back after consulting with the Chief of
        Air Staff that the same weight of bombs fired during some 42 minutes of the operation would have taken a wellington squadron from Malta ten and half weeks, or one 
        Stirling squadron from Egypt in about thirty weeks. And of course, Churchill would say during the initiative to appease hitler that, "the great dominate <span class="italic">fact</span> is that Germany is re-arming, has
        already begun to re-arm." Orwell, on the other hand, had a keen eye for when facts where being altered. Or at least he would be brave enough to speak out when someone would try to do so. Orwell would eventually 
        say that a "peculiarity" of the totalitarian state is that even though it sets up and controls an un-questionable dogma, it alters it from day to day. A clear pattern emerges by the end of the book about these two 
        figures, and that is that they are both defiant to the core, indomitable of will, and won't just lay down in the face of what they consider evil. And thank God they didn't.
