    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;This is a review of "George and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom" by Thomas E. Ricks. Going into this assignment, 
        I only knew a handful of things about either historical figure. Churchill was of course the leader of Britain during World War II, and George Orwell is the author
        of the social science fiction dystopia "1984" and his political satire "Animal Farm." Aside from those popularly understood things
        about these two historical figures, that's all that I know. But, that's why I've chosen this book for review, and I'm very exited to learn
        the details about these two incredibly influential people.
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="head">1A. How interesting to read was the authors writing style.</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book is definitely a page turner. Partly because
        the subject matter is the explosive final chapter of the 20th century that essentially sets ups our current way of life and thinking, but mostly because the 
        narrative tells a good story; that being the second world war from Churchill and Orwell's perspective. "In doing so, Chamberlain gave Germany a 
        free hand to begin taking apart Czechoslovakia, beginning with one third of its population and its system of frontier defenses. Churchill responded: 
        “The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small State to the wolves is a fatal delusion.” Chamberlain told the Cabinet that he believed Hitler trusted him.
        On September 29, Chamberlain flew to Germany for his third meeting that month with Hitler. Returning to London, he proclaimed that he had secured “peace for our time.” He
        was greeted by cheering crowds in the streets" (Ricks 61). The author's writing
        style is very compelling, and a lot of detail is given very succinctly. "[Orwell] went to Spain to fight fascism, 
        but instead wound up being hunted by communists. This is the central fact of his experience of the Spanish Civil War, and indeed 
        it is the key fact of his entire life. But had a sniper’s bullet plunged into his neck just a little differently in May 1937, he would never have written his first great book, 
        <span>Homage to Catalonia</span>. And the world never would have met the great writer who holds our attention even now" (Ricks 46). 
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="head">1B. How easy to understand was the authors writing?</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The author mentions an essay by Orwell in 1945 titled "Politics and the English Language"
        wherein Orwell offers six rules for writing. "Orwell usually wrote as an observer, but here he is a prescriber, laying down rules and offering advice. A careful writer, he instructs, 
        should ask himself about every sentence a series of questions, such as what he is trying to say and what words will best express it. He should be especially careful about using stale, worn-out 
        imagery that fails to really evoke an image in the reader’s mind.
        He summarizes his points succinctly, offering six “elementary” rules . . . Any writer today would do well to post those rules on the wall of his or her work space" (Ricks 195). I don't think I 
        understand these rules well enough to practice them myself yet, but after the author mentions the rules, 
        I noticed that he was following them and had been following them the whole time. It's clear that the author took this essay to heart and as such the book 
        is extremely easy to understand. There is a humerus passage where he quotes a book written by John Rodden about George Orwell. 
        "It is not at all clear that Orwell would approve of these works, especially when they contain opaque sentences such as this: “Typically the primary watchword is the point of departure for the evolution 
        of variants, but the variants may also serve as the basis for establishing the primary watchword. What distinguishes certain watchwords as ‘primary’ is not temporal priority but centrality and frequency of 
        occurrence in a reception history.” One must wonder how anyone who has read “Politics and the English Language” could write such a sentence" (Ricks 261).
        I'm very glad "Churchill and Orwell" was not written like this.
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="head">1C. How was the book generally structured?</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book was very well paced. The first chapter, "The Two Winstons," is a brief introduction into Churchill and Orwell, followed by a chapter dedicated to Churchill titled, "Churchill
        The Adventurer," and then a chapter dedicated to Orwell titled, "Orwell The Policeman." The book mostly bounces back and forth between the two figures, dedicating a chapter to each. The middle
        of the book shifts primarily to Churchill as it covers the second world war, before mostly moving back into the groove of alternating chapters. The brief mentions of the other figure outside of their
        respective chapters still happens and is very seamlessly done. The beginning of the book is suspenseful, and the endings for the respective chapters for each figure 
        before the war begins are eerily prophetic. "[Homage to Catalonia] ends beautifully, and unexpectedly, with Orwell’s appreciation of the Edenic landscape of southern England as he arrives home—and then with a
        warning to the inhabitants of that green and pleasant land: 
        <div class="in-line-margin"> It was still the England I had known in my childhood: the railway-cuttings smothered in wild flowers, the deep meadows where the great 
        shining horses browse and meditate, the slow-moving streams bordered by willows, the green bosoms of the elms, the larkspurs in the cottage gardens; and then the huge peaceful wilderness of outer London, 
        the barges on the miry river, the familiar streets, the posters telling of cricket matches and Royal weddings, the men in bowler hats, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, the red buses, the blue policemen—all 
        sleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs.</div>
        This is a wonderful sentence, worth reading aloud. It is closely observed, it is infused with his love of England, and it is, most of all, eerily prophetic. It was written in mid-1937, at a time when British 
        leaders were seeking peace through appeasement, and much of the population voiced support for pacifism" (Ricks 80-81). After the war if covered, the book maintains interest all the way to the end as it 
        covers the ongoing legacy of these two figures. "An Iraqi writer, Hassan Abdulrazzak, said in 2015, “I’m sure George Orwell didn’t think: ‘I must write an instructive tale for a boy from Iraq,’ when he wrote 1984. 
        But that book explained Iraq under Saddam for me better than anything else before or since”" (Ricks 269). 
    </div>
    <!-- <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book was paced very well. The author goes back and forth on Churchill and Orwell, generally focusing on one for a chapter and then the other. The first chapters are
        briefly about their early careers and politics, followed by a chapter for each that ends right before the second world world. Both chapters ending in 
        eerie prophesy predicting the impending war. Each one of those two chapters is so engrossing, and ends on such a prophetic cliffhanger, that the transition to the 
        other historical figure in the following chapter is almost disappointing. I say almost, as the 
        following chapter has equal appeal and ramps the tension just as much. 
        This eventually leads to a big payoff in the middle of the book. The closing chapters of the book are very similar to the closing chapters in either figure's lives. The big 
        battle was over, and now that both figures could see victory the world that they would survive in was a little darker then they had time to imagine before. Both Churchill and Orwell
        where in a very dark and dreary time in their lives, and the tone of the book reflects that. The book ends with the lasting legacy of the two, and how each figure becomes 
        more and more deified as time goes one. The overall pacing reminds me of how the author describes Churchill's memoirs. The beginning is excellent, the middle is more practical and
        not as bombastic, and then it ends with a big pop. The big pop in Churchill's memoirs being his account of the Normandy Landings. "Churchill and Orwell" would thankfully
        stop with a pop, unlike the memoirs.
    </div> -->
    <!-- <h1 class="head">2A. explain the main themes</h1> -->
    <div>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The main theme of the book is the simultaneous struggle against the growing totalitarianism of the 20th century. Both figures where very keen and 
    recognized the threat of communism and fascism, and the book details their efforts against it, even if it meant challenging their own colleagues and peers at times. "Reginald Fletcher said in a debate in June 1939. “The Government invariably 
    reject [Churchill's] warnings, but over and over again we find them having to adopt his proposals at a far higher price than they need have paid had they heeded him in the first instance.” 
    Even then, Chamberlain stoutly resisted bringing Churchill into a position of leadership" (Ricks 67). Churchill and Orwell both knew they weren't going make many allies with their positions. "[Homage to Catalonia] begins as a very good tale of going to war, and then, two thirds 
    of the way through, when Orwell runs into the Stalinist crackdown on other leftists in Barcelona, turns into a noirish political thriller. In that narrative, Orwell hammers home two points. 
    The first is that Soviet-dominated communism should not be trusted by other leftists. The second is that the left can be every bit as accepting of lies as the right.
    Orwell knew that neither of these themes would win him friends on the British left" (Ricks 79). The books makes it clear that Churchill and Orwell weren't going to stay quiet about what they saw
    was the truth. And they would find themselves staring down great adversity, but ultimately, the book shows that just how lasting the legacy of their actions would be for us even in our 
    modern time. "The leftist Hitchens went even further, asserting, “[Orwell] owns the twentieth century, as a writer about fascism and communism and imperialism, in a way that no other writer in English can claim”" (Ricks 268).
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="head">2B. Explain how well the author supported the book's main themes.</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Thomas E. Ricks is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, and it shows with this book. Ricks draws from many primary and secondary sources to support the books main themes. Many sources
        include actual war documents. "We now know that on May 23, 1939, Hitler brought his top military officials to his study in his Chancellery to unfold his plans for war, which, he said, he deemed unavoidable. 
        First, he intended “to attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity.” Eventually, there would be a “life and death struggle” with England. He laid out the conditions needed for a German victory there. 
        “If Holland and Belgium are successfully occupied and held, and if France is also defeated, the fundamental conditions for a successful war against England will have been secured. England can then be blocked 
        from Western France at close quarters by the Air Force, while the Navy with its submarines can extend the range of our blockade.” He did not mention the United States in this document, according to the translation 
        used in the postwar Nuremberg trials. There is evidence that at this point he envisioned fighting the United States, but only after subduing Europe and the Soviet Union" (Ricks 65-66).
        My personal favorites are the personal letters and journals from Churchill and Orwell. "September 17 [1938], Churchill inspected part of the British fleet in Scotland’s saltwater Loch Ewe, including the 
        antisubmarine nets at the loch’s mouth, and then began the drive across the highlands to the train station in Inverness. It was a warm, dry day, so he interrupted his journey by picnicking by a hill 
        stream. As he was sitting in that idyllic spot, some grim memories of World War I crept over him, chilling him despite the abundant sunshine. “Somehow the light faded out of the landscape” as he considered 
        his situation, and the globe’s: “Poland in its agony; France but a pale reflection of her former warlike ardour; the Russian Colossus no longer an ally, not even neutral, possibly to become a foe. Italy 
        no friend. Japan no ally. Would America ever come in again? The British Empire remained intact and gloriously united, but ill-prepared, unready. We still had command of the sea. We were woefully outmatched 
        in numbers in this new mortal weapon of the air.” In that moment of reflection he girded himself for war" (Ricks 91). 
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="head">2C. Outside of the main themes, give two other opinions likes or dislikes about the people, places, events this AUTHOR has.</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The author has a clear admiration for Churchill, and though it doesn't get in the way of an objective assessment, it is noticeable.
        "More recently, a small band of academics has surfaced with revisionist takes on Churchill carrying lurid titles such as <span>Churchill Unmasked</span>. But they appear to have little impact on the larger public, or even on 
        more strategically minded scholars such as Eliot Cohen. Essentially these books consist of asking the reader to forget about the forest of Churchill’s life and instead focus on a few trees that a given writer 
        believes deserve more attention" (Ricks 225). Here you can see the author has a slightly defensive response to criticisms of Churchill. Ricks does generally avoid hero worship in his analysis of Churchill and Orwell,
        and is still justifiably critical of many aspects of either figure, such Orwell’s obsession with smell. "More strikingly, this part of [The Road to Wigan Pier] also displays one of Orwell’s oddest ventures, his attempt to build a 
        political theory upon his hypersensitive sense of smell. “The real secret of class distinctions in the West . . . is summed up in four frightful words . . . The lower classes smell.” Almost any other fault can be overcome, he asserts. 
        “You can have an affection for a murderer or sodomite, but you cannot have an affection for a man whose breath stinks—habitually stinks, I mean. . . . You will hate him.” He goes on about this for several pages in prose probably best 
        understood by those tormented by overdeveloped olfactory receptors, an affliction known as hyperosmia" (Ricks 41).
    </div>
    <!-- <h1 class="head">2D. Explain how well the AUTHOR supported their opinions.</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Even when the book covers the personal lives of Churchill and Orwell, and when the author gives his opinions of these lives, Ricks always ties everything back to the main theme
        of their commitment to freedom and democracy. You always maintain a clear sense that they fought hard for what they accomplished. "Churchill struck a surer, clearer note than the prime minister. “This is not a question of fighting for Danzig or fighting for Poland. We are fighting to save the whole world from the 
        pestilence of Nazi tyranny and in defence of all that is most sacred to man. This is no war for domination or imperial aggrandisement or material gain; no war to shut any country out of its sunlight and means of progress. It is a war, 
        viewed in its inherent quality, to establish, on impregnable rocks, the rights of the individual, and it is a war to establish and revive the stature of man.”
        George Orwell may not have believed those words coming from Churchill, but he certainly agreed with the principles stated in them, especially the last sentence about the rights and place of the individual. Years later, he would write, 
        “Intellectual liberty . . . without a doubt has been one of the distinguishing marks of western civilisation.” He also commented that “if this war is about anything at all, it is a war in favour of freedom of thought.”" 
        Six days after Churchill’s speech, Orwell wrote to the British government asking to be given a role in the war effort. This was to prove to be a long, frustrating struggle for him" (Ricks 89).
    </div>
    <!-- <h1>3A. Describe at least one good point and at least one bad point about the book.</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The best aspect of the book has to be how Ricks tells a cohesive story. Even knowing the outcome of the lives of these men, and the outcome
        of the 20th century, the book impressively still gives a sense that things are touch-and-go, and as such stays very exiting. "On the evening of June 17, Churchill ordered a statement broadcast on the BBC that began with, “The news from France 
        is very bad.” Paris had fallen to the Germans. The next day, the French government requested armistice talks. The military historian Walter Millis elegantly summarized the alarming military situation after Dunkirk: “Great Britain was 
        left almost without ground defenses, while the occupation of nearly the whole Atlantic coast of Europe had opened innumerable unsealable gateways to the depredations of the U-boats.” Indeed, the conditions that Hitler had laid out just 
        thirteen months earlier had been reached: Poland had been taken, Belgium and Holland occupied, and France defeated. Now England stood alone in western Europe. Hitler planned to pummel and starve it" (Ricks 108). This passage is the 
        lead in to Churchill's "finest hour" speech. I had never heard the the whole speech beforehand, but after the book covers the collapse of France after the many setbacks of the war, the speech is incredibly evocative. "Churchill warned his countrymen, in another theatrical conclusion:
        <div class="in-line-margin">The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him all Europe may be free, and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands; 
            but if we fail then the whole world, including the United States, and all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more prolonged, by the lights of a perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so 
            bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years men will still say, “This was their finest hour.”</div>
        Roy Jenkins compares the significance of this speech with Lincoln’s address at Gettysburg" (Ricks 108). There is very little bad I have to say about the book at all. It's pleasant and informative from start to finish.
    </div>
    <!-- <h1>3B. How appropriate was this book for the class?</h1> -->
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;I thought this book was incredibly relevant to our western civilization class. As Christopher Hitchens was previously mentioned saying, Orwell absolutely owns the 
        20th century. I would go so far as to say this book should be required reading. "It is a stretch, but perhaps not too much, to say that Churchill and Orwell—along with many others—may have helped contribute to the conditions that made possible the economic boom of the late twentieth century. 
        Churchill through his actions as a war leader made possible the postwar world. The Cold War was the consequence of World War II, and the conclusion of that conflict was ordained by the events of 1940, which had Churchill at their center. Russia and the United States, not then in the war, ultimately 
        would win the war, but in 1940, Churchill was significant as “the one who did not lose it,” observed the Hungarian-born historian John Lukacs, who himself was a prisoner of the Nazis during World War II. The British writer Paul Johnson probably put it best when he wrote, “Everyone who values freedom 
        under law, and government by, for and from the people, can find comfort and reassurance in his life story”" (Ricks 280). There is not better overview of the 20th century than from the perspective of the man who kept it together, and the man who got it right.
    </div>
    <!-- <h1>3C. Tell me something you learned that gives you a better understanding of the society we live in.</h1> -->
    <div>
        The biggest thing I learned while reading this book is just how close the world came to going either fully communist or fascist, and how much we owe both Churchill and Orwell for being a voice and bulwark for the concept of individual liberty. Even today, Orwell has us on watch with the tools he created. "It is often observed that [Orwell] is one of the few writers to have 
        contributed words and phrases to our language—“doublethink,” “Big Brother,” “memory hole,” “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others”" (Ricks 277). I learned just how far people will go to avoid discomfort. "The term “psychological avoidance” is what Taylor Branch uses repeatedly in the 
        first volume of his biography of Martin Luther King Jr. to describe the initial mainstream reaction in white America to the civil rights movement. The biggest problem civil rights activists faced in the America of the 1950s and 1960s was not prejudice per se, not even always in the South. Rather, it was 
        a reluctance even among well-meaning people to address a festering wrong that could wait no longer" (Rick 282). But most importantly, I learned the value of the heresiarch. "As we deal with terrorism, global warming, domestic inequality, and racism, and also with panicky politicians and demagogic leaders, 
        we would do well to remember how these two men reacted to the overwhelming events of their own time. They were especially good at recognizing the delusions of their own social 
        sets—always a useful tool, if not a good way to make and keep friends" (Ricks 281).
