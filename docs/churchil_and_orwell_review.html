        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;This is a review of "George and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom" by Thomas E. Ricks. Going into this assignment, 
        I only knew a handful of things about either historical figure. Churchill was of course the leader of Britain during World War II, and George Orwell is the author
        of the social science fiction dystopia "1984" and his political satire "Animal Farm.". Aside from those popularly understood things
        about these two historical figures, that's all that I know. But, that's why I've chosen this book for review, and I'm very exited to learn
        the details about these two incredibly influential people.

    <h1 class="head">1A. How interesting to read was the authors writing style.</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book is definitely a page turner. Partly because
        the subject matter is the explosive final chapter of the 20th century that essentially sets ups our current way of life and thinking, but mostly because the 
        narrative tells a good story; that being the second world war from Churchill and Orwell's perspective. "In doing so, Chamberlain gave Germany a 
        free hand to begin taking apart Czechoslovakia, beginning with one third of its population and its system of frontier defenses. Churchill responded: 
        “The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small State to the wolves is a fatal delusion.” Chamberlain told the Cabinet that he believed Hitler trusted him.
        On September 29, Chamberlain flew to Germany for his third meeting that month with Hitler. Returning to London, he proclaimed that he had secured “peace for our time.” He
         was greeted by cheering crowds in the streets" (Ricks 61). You can definitely tell Churchill is fighting an uphill battle with that. "[Orwell] went to Spain to fight fascism, 
         but instead wound up being hunted by communists. This is the central fact of his experience of the Spanish Civil War, and indeed 
         it is the key fact of his entire life. But had a sniper’s bullet plunged into his neck just a little differently in May 1937, he would never have written his first great book, 
         Homage to Catalonia. And the world never would have met the  great writer who holds our attention even now" (Ricks 46). Even knowing the outcome of the lives of these men, and the outcome
         of the events that happened within them, the book still gives a sense that things are touch-and-go, and as such stays very exiting.

    <h1 class="head">1B. How easy to understand was the authors writing?</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The author mentions an essay by Orwell in 1945 titled "Politics and the English Language"
        wherein Orwell offers six rules for writing. "Orwell usually wrote as an observer, but here he is a prescriber, laying down rules and offering advice. A careful writer, he instructs, 
        should ask himself about every sentence a series of questions, such as what he is trying to say and what words will best express it. He should be especially careful about using stale, worn-out 
        imagery that fails to really evoke an image in the reader’s mind.
        He summarizes his points succinctly, offering six “elementary” rules . . . Any writer today would do well to post those rules on the wall of his or her work space" (Ricks 195). I don't think I 
        understand these rules well enough to practice them myself yet, but after the author mentions the rules, 
        I noticed that he was following them and had been following them the whole time. It's clear that the author took this essay to heart and as such the book 
        is extremely easy to understand. There's a humerus passage where he quotes a book written by John Rodden about George Orwell. 
        "It is not at all clear that Orwell would approve of these works, especially when they contain opaque sentences such as this: “Typically the primary watchword is the point of departure for the evolution 
        of variants, but the variants may also serve as the basis for establishing the primary watchword. What distinguishes certain watchwords as ‘primary’ is not temporal priority but centrality and frequency of 
        occurrence in a reception history.” One must wonder how anyone who has read “Politics and the English Language” could write such a sentence" (Ricks 261).
        I'm very glad "Churchill and Orwell" was not written like this.

    <h1 class="head">1C. How was the book generally structured?</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book was very well paced. The first chapter, "The Two Winstons," is a brief introduction into Churchill and Orwell, followed by a chapter dedicated to Churchill titled, "Churchill
        The Adventurer," and then a chapter dedicated to Orwell titled, "Orwell The Policeman." The book mostly bounces back and forth between the two figures, dedicating a chapter to each. The middle
        of the book shifts primarily to Churchill as it covers the second world war, before mostly moving back into the groove of alternating chapters. The brief mentions of the other figure outside of their
        chapter still happens and are very seamlessly done. The beginning of the book is suspenseful, as it 
        leads into world war 2, which is somewhat surprizing given the reader is likely to understand what's about to happen very well. Still, the endings for the respective chapters for each figure 
        before the war begins are eerily prophetic. "[Homage to Catalonia] ends beautifully, and unexpectedly, with Orwell’s appreciation of the Edenic landscape of southern England as he arrives home—and then with a
        warning to the inhabitants of that green and pleasant land: 
        <div class="in-line-margin"> It was still the England I had known in my childhood: the railway-cuttings smothered in wild flowers, the deep meadows where the great 
        shining horses browse and meditate, the slow-moving streams bordered by willows, the green bosoms of the elms, the larkspurs in the cottage gardens; and then the huge peaceful wilderness of outer London, 
        the barges on the miry river, the familiar streets, the posters telling of cricket matches and Royal weddings, the men in bowler hats, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, the red buses, the blue policemen—all 
        sleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs.</div>
        This is a wonderful sentence, worth reading aloud. It is closely observed, it is infused with his love of England, and it is, most of all, eerily prophetic. It was written in mid-1937, at a time when British 
        leaders were seeking peace through appeasement, and much of the population voiced support for pacifism" (Ricks 80-81). After the war if covered, the book maintains interest all the way to the end as it 
        covers the ongoing legacy of these two figures. "An Iraqi writer, Hassan Abdulrazzak, said in 2015, “I’m sure George Orwell didn’t think: ‘I must write an instructive tale for a boy from Iraq,’ when he wrote 1984. 
        But that book explained Iraq under Saddam for me better than anything else before or since”" (Ricks 269). 
    </div>
    <!-- <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The book was paced very well. The author goes back and forth on Churchill and Orwell, generally focusing on one for a chapter and then the other. The first chapters are
        briefly about their early careers and politics, followed by a chapter for each that ends right before the second world world. Both chapters ending in 
        eerie prophesy predicting the impending war. Each one of those two chapters is so engrossing, and ends on such a prophetic cliffhanger, that the transition to the 
        other historical figure in the following chapter is almost disappointing. I say almost, as the 
        following chapter has equal appeal and ramps the tension just as much. 
        This eventually leads to a big payoff in the middle of the book. The closing chapters of the book are very similar to the closing chapters in either figure's lives. The big 
        battle was over, and now that both figures could see victory the world that they would survive in was a little darker then they had time to imagine before. Both Churchill and Orwell
        where in a very dark and dreary time in their lives, and the tone of the book reflects that. The book ends with the lasting legacy of the two, and how each figure becomes 
        more and more deified as time goes one. The overall pacing reminds me of how the author describes Churchill's memoirs. The beginning is excellent, the middle is more practical and
        not as bombastic, and then it ends with a big pop. The big pop in Churchill's memoirs being his account of the Normandy Landings. "Churchill and Orwell" would thankfully
        stop with a pop, unlike the memoirs.

    <h1 class="head">2A. explain the main themes</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;So why compare Churchill and Orwell? Both men certainly where anti totalitarianism, but how much more similarity could there be? Well, as it turns out, quote a lot. Both had poor 
        relationships with their fathers, both came of age in remote parts of the British Empire, both where writers, and both had near death experiences that should have absolutely left them dead and the world 
        completely unrecognizable as a result. Overall the most similar feature is that these two men would be the absolute greatest figures
        of the 20th centaury when it came to predicting and resisting the future of human total authority. The 20th century absolutely needed them both. In the case of Churchill, there 
        was no one else set up to take the stand for Britain after Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, showing that appeasement clearly had done nothing. Other British leaders, such as Lord Halifax, would 
        have likely betrayed the country and capitulated to Hitler. In the case of Orwell, he gave us clear insight into the rhetoric and abuses of power by the left and have us language to understand it, such as 
        phrases like "double speak," and "memory hole." 
    </div>
    <h1 class="head">2B. Explain how well the author supported the book's main themes.</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;But as much as totalitarianism is evil, the truth at the root of problem according to the book is, in fact, truth itself. Before even talking about the state rewriting history in 1984, the author
        constantly mentions how both Churchill and Orwell were fact focused characters. The author would often show instances of Churchill not taking anything for granted and doing his own fact finding. 
        The book mentions an exchange with one of Churchill's admiralty, Admiral Cunningham, in which Cunningham doubts the success of a mission he carried out at Churchill's request, stating that 
        while the 5 day mission was a success with no casualties, a "heavy flight squadron working from Egypt could probably carry out in a few hours." Churchill would fire back after consulting with the Chief of
        Air Staff that the same weight of bombs fired during some 42 minutes of the operation would have taken a wellington squadron from Malta ten and half weeks, or one 
        Stirling squadron from Egypt in about thirty weeks. And of course, Churchill would say during the initiative to appease hitler that, "the great dominate <span class="italic">fact</span> is that Germany is re-arming, has
        already begun to re-arm." Orwell, on the other hand, had a keen eye for when facts where being altered. Or at least he would be brave enough to speak out when someone would try to do so. Orwell would eventually 
        say that a "peculiarity" of the totalitarian state is that even though it sets up and controls an un-questionable dogma, it alters it from day to day. A clear pattern emerges by the end of the book about these two 
        figures, and that is that they are both defiant to the core, indomitable of will, and won't just lay down in the face of what they consider evil. And thank God they didn't.
