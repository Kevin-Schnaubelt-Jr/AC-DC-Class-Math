    <h1>Opening Paragraph</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;This is a review of "George and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom" by Thomas E. Ricks. Going into this assignment, 
        I only know a handful of things about either historical figure. Churhcill was of course the leader of Britain during World War II, and
        althought not nessciarily unpopular, he lost his reellection following the war. George Orwell is of course 
        famous for his social science fiction dystopia "1984" and his political satire "Animal Farm.". Aside from those popularly understood things
        about these two historical figures, that's all that I know. But, that's why I've chosen this book for review, and I'm very exited to learn
        the details about these two incredibly influential people.
