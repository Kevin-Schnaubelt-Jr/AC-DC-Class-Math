    <p>
        &emsp;This is a review of "George and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom" by Thomas E. Ricks. Going into this assignment, 
        I only know a handful of things about either historical figure. Churhcill was of course the leader of Britain during World War II, and
        althought not nessciarily unpopular, he lost his reellection following the war. However, that's all I know about him. George Orwell is of course 
        one of the most famous science fiction writers of all time, probably most famous for War of the Worlds. But again, aside from what he is generally known
        for, that's really all I personably undestand about him. I chose this particalar book to review because, despite not knowing much about them, I know
        enough to be very excited to learn more!
