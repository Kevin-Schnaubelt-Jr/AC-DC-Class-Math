    The beginning of the moderate stage of the French Revolution, starting
with the arrest of and execution of Robespierre on charges of abuse of power,
would be a sign of regressing towards the mean. Robespierre had gone too far and 
was obviously corrupted by his power. Ironic, then, that the moderate stage would 
roll into the Napoleonic phase, which was a 180 right back to where it had started.

    The Assembly was founded, resulting in the French government becoming a bicameral 
organization designed to split power up between two branches. The Directory now 
had to share power with the Assembly, and never again would a despot be created like
with the "Committee of Public Safety." Unfortunately, the power was still lopsided,
and the Directory had an overwhelming amount of influence due to having strong veto power.

    With their overwhelming influence, the Directory would push for a light domestic
agenda and a heavy foreign policy. The economy of France was still in shambles, and 
the directory reasoned that a continued military agenda would keep everything running.
They would eventually glorify the military to that end, especially glorifying 
military heroes. The most famous of which was, of course, Napoleon.

    Napoleon would eventually rise through the ranks of the military due to seemingly through
ability alone. He would eventually become a big political player, rising to become the
leader of the nation. He would adopt the role of the "enlightened despot" which was really
just what Robespierre was. In 1802 he was voted in as Consul for life, and in 1804 he 
was crowned by the pope becoming the Emperor of France.

    Some progressive things would stick over time, sure. But in general, things would go 
right back to the way they were before the the moderate stage, and similarly to Robespierre, 
it would be a violent and short lived flame.
