    I think the most important factor for the successful growth of the Constitutional Monarchy 
in England would have to be the geography of the British Isles. As much as we like to credit human
history to people or groups, all major human development is guided by the almost invisible hand of
location. Whether it be a river or a hunting ground, all human events revolve around a resource location
or major route or road connecting them. Being an island nation meant a strong navy would be priority number one. 
And because the rest of western civilization had comparatively weak navies, coupled with the fact that 
the English Channel separated the British Isles from the rest of Europe, the British Isles became an impenetrable fortress.

    Number two would have to be the creation of Parliament. I'm still confused on how the formation of a 
second branch of government next to a divinely ordained king was allowed to happen, but certainly even the 
idea that the king was not the only option for governance devalued his power, and eased people into the idea 
of individual rights and powers.

    Number three would have to be the Magna Carta. This created the whole idea of a binding document that 
contained laws that are applied universally to a group of people. It would even expand it's protections to more 
and more people.

    And last, Common Law. Though similar to the Magna Carta, common law was more about applying laws universally across
the physical kingdom so that everyone would be on the same page on what needed to be adherent too while traveling. Still,
another example of a "universal" method for interpreting law.
