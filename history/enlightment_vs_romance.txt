    Enlightenment vs Romanticism

    It seems that, when talking about the romantic period, you have to talk about the enlightenment period. The enlightenment period stands on it's own, 
while the romantic period is a response to enlightenment. Reason is still there for romantics, and is even a core tenant, it's just secondary to 
feeling. I have to say, I'm very biased toward the enlightenment period. I almost wish I was there. To see how rapid the growth of science and skepticism 
was at the outset of the scientific method. I probably would have been then what I am now; a fairly unrestrained critic of theism, similar to the
Philosophes. 

    As much as I might disagree with the romantics, though, on the promotion of organized religion and pantheism, they do have several good points. The reaction
to enlightenment certainly doesn't seem unwarranted, as the continued realization of the insignificance of humans on the cosmic scale seemed to have obfuscated 
the reality that humans are still very significant on the HUMAN scale. I've always though that art is humans greatest achievement, beyond and technology or other
innovation. Art for art's sake is incredibly important. I honestly wouldn't trust anyone or any culture that was anti art in any way. It's just wrong. Inhuman. 
Similar, I suppose, to the factories and other types of labor during the Industrial Revolution. As much as I have a soft spot for the scientific revolution, 
the incredible works of art during the romantic period are undeniable impactful on even the modern psyche.
