French Revolution: Democratic Phase

1) Ancien (old) Regime (pre - 1789) - over hundreds of years. key political movement of the modern west. Important source of egalitarianism and nationalism.
    * Build upon a feudal system.
    * 3 main social classes * * society is agricultural. based on social inequality. small elite has most power and wealth.
    A) 1st Estate - Catholic Clergy (estate means social class). Either priests, monks, or nuns. Some become bishops/cardinals etc. All clergy. 
        * maybe 1% of the population are clergy. Major part of all people's lives. Entertainment, marriage, all of it.
        * church still makes products such as wine and bread.
        1) Tithes => 10% income tax to the church.
        2) Voluntary Gift => every 5 years.
    B) 2nd Estate - Aristocracy - those with title - only a few are super rich - main land owners.
        1) Landowners => farming rents. percentages of crops grown or animals slaughtered. dominated key positions. Most officers are from here.
            * Most key advisers are here. Very few (2-3%) are commoners.
        2) Many Tax Exemptions - such as a bread tax or toll. 
    C) 3rd Estate - Commoners - about 5%
        1) Bourgeoisie - middle class - make up the bulk of business owners.
            A) business owners (class) - merchants, manufacturers (clothing - iron), using traditional sources.
                * could also be bankers, lawyer, painter, sculpture, writer.
            B) some tax exemptions - but still pay more.
        2) Urban Workers - initially about 5% - wage earners. Every tax. poor.
        3) Peasantry - about 80% of the population. Lived a hard life, but had it better in overall life than in central europe. 
            A) agricultural workers/ small farmers - doesn't own land. Aristocracy or clergy own the land. 
            B) high taxes
            C) corvee - state required free labor. road work. You drafted for infrastructure.

2) Main Causes - 
    A) Continuous Warfare - 
        * both civil + foreign fighting. - constant demand for soldiers.
    B) Highly Unbalanced Tax system - 
        * Feudal system
    C) huge national debts
        * continual deficit spending - constantly defaulting.
    D) American Revolution - helped because anti british.
        * Democratic Success of America resonates with commoners in France.

3) Opening Stage (1789 - 91)
    A) Spark - government bankruptcy - severe financial crisis.
        1) Ruler => Louis XVI (16) (r. 1774 - 1792)
        2) Indecisive Response - not a firm decision maker, young. First instinct was to tax the clergy more. (untapped resources.)
            * calls in the council and doesn't end up raising taxes.
    B) Estates General - (May, 1789) (council to advice) - last time they met was 1614
        1) National Membership Election's
        2) Voting Procedure Struggle. - paralyzing disagreement. By block or by individual member. 
        3) Tennis Court Oath => national assembly (NA) 3rd state asked to just fuck off to the tennis court. Takes place in late June.
            * Locked out dudes said were not leaving. Stay until France becomes a constitutional monarchy. Considers itself the National Assembly.
        4) Upper Class Inaction. - during that time they just hang around. Eventually Louis the 16th tries to call the cops to get them out.
    C) Storming of the Bastille - (july 14, 1789) - still celebrated to this day.
        1) massive urban poor riot - terrible starving living conditions. form mobs and blockage the streets.
            * break into the prison (bastille) and free everyone. King's troops either retreat or join the rioters.
            * Louis the 16th doesn't call in the rest of the troops over fear they wouldn't so shit either.
        2) result = "Great Fear" - Peasant revolts once word gets out. Most were successful. Nobility is afraid.
    D) Key National Assembly Reforms.
        1) Declaration of the Rights of Man. France now stands for liberty, fraternity, equality. egalitarianism essentially. 
            * Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.
        2) Constitution of 1791.
            A) Constitution monarchy
            B) classical liberalism / democracy. - belief in the idea of protecting citizen rights and promoting progress.
                * Sovereignty - Ultimate power to run society rests with the people/ all classes
                * Self-determination - All people have a right to choose their own form of government => based on ethnicity.
        3) Catholic Church has a New Boss. The people / new parliament. Clergy were made state employees.
        4) Metric system was developed. 
        5) Results => political extremist dissatisfaction
            A) Right - conservatives sat on the right side and wanted to go back to absolutism. assholes still.
            B) Left - people way on the left were more pro whatever.
