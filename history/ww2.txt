    B) Poland - (april 1939)
        1) Nazi - Soviet Pact
            * They both hate Poland, and so they divide Poland up.
        2) German Invasion -> "Blitzkrieg" or lightning War

2) Pearl Harbor - (dec 7th, 1941)
    A) Origins -> US/ Japanese Pacific Ocean Rivalry

        * three differences
            1) trade rivals - Both trading with China.
            2) empire - both US and Japan has colonies here. The US has the Philippines. The US takes the lead on enforcing anti Japan empire.
            3) racial - America was racist against the Japanese, and the Japanese are racist against Americans.
    B) Japanese Surprise Attack
        1) Military Success
            * Most ships there are sunk or damaged. Most of the Army air core was destroyed. 
            * No aircraft carriers were luckily there, and so they survived.
