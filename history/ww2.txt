    B) Poland - (april 1939)
        1) Nazi - Soviet Pact

            1) trade rivals - Both trading with China.

            * Most ships there are sunk or damaged. Most of the Army air core was destroyed. 
            * No aircraft carriers were luckily there, and so they survived.
        2) Political mistake
