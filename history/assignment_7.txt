    I would have to say the most important advantage britain had was a strong middle class.
Unlike other cultures and places, the different social classes didn't intermingle as well as
they did in Britain. The middle class was decently respected and give the reigns to be 
industrious. This would lead to them becoming the biggest and wealthiest group in 18th century 
Europe.

    At number two: excellent transportation. Being an island nation, the production and use of
sea travel was well established. This allowed Britain to not only have access to business and 
resources outside the country, but would also allow them to travel along their own rivers and 
canals. 

    At number three: accessibility to necessary raw materials. This is where things start to look
like a perfect storm for Britain. Access to natural resources is usually the deciding factor in
any civilizations success, and the natural resources Britain had access to on their home
terf was exactly what they needed, mainly iron and coal. 

    Number four: A pro-business government. Both the monarchy and parliament of Britain were 
all in agreement on the importance of promoting businesses. This would lead to tax law that 
would allow profits from commercial enterprise to outpace rent. They would also encourage 
businesses to invest overseas instead of trying to restrict business to the mainland.

    Number five: capitalism. The philosophy of an unrestricted market would allow businesses
to grow very quickly. Whatever worked would work and grow, and whatever didn't work would
would leave the market.
