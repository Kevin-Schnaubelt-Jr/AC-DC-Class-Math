    * Veterans day is based on the cease fire.
    * no multi nations war for the last 100 years.
    * Most nations get involved because of trade contacts
    * most people thought it would last a couple months.
    * Starts in europe but spreads

1) Main Causes
    A) Long Terms Causes - around for a generation
        1) Entangling Alliances - all the great powers of europe are going to divide themselves into rival groups.
            A) Triple Alliance => 1882 - Germany, austria/hungry, italy. Put together by Bismark. 
            B) triple entente => 1907 (entente means alliance in french) - Great Britain, France, Russia.
                * made up of traditional rivals
        2) Extreme nationalism - translates into my country, right or wrong. - makes you thin skinned and reactive.
        3) Militarism - poplar because social darwinism. Sword Logic.
            * excessive love of fighting. Diplomacy is seen as weak.
        4) Imperialism - Colonies contribute to bickering. 
        5) Poor Leadership - By all the great powers, especially Germany under Kaiser william II.
            * All tolerated extreme nationalism, militarism, and imperialism. 
    B) Short-term cause -
        * Political Murder =? Austria Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
        * Serbian killers? Almost didn't even work out.
        * They want a war with serbia.
    C) Opposing Sides - summer of 1914 - the allies or entente.
        1) Allies - Britain, France, Russia, Serbia and Belgium.
            * by 1918 = 28 nations
        2) Central Powers - Germany + A-hungry
            * By 1918 = 4 nations. Bulgaria and the ottoman empire, or Turkey.
        3) Main Neutral Nation - 
            * United States => Problem: Most Americans were former Europeans.



2) Decisive Early Battles
    * set the tone for future fighting here
    A) 1st Battle of the Marne - The Marne is a river.
        * Sept 1914 -> NE France
        1) German Offensive to capture Paris - felt that if the told Belgium that if they allow us though, they leave after and pay them.
            => the Schliffen Plan - after messing up france, rail car to Russia.
                * They get close but they where stopped before they get to Paris.
        2) Allied Victory (french/british)
            * Germans still hold ground all over that section of France. Get bogged down.
    B) Battle of Trannenberg - 
        * August 1914 => East Prussia.
        1) Russian Offensive to capture Berlin
            => allied counter-attack
        2) Crushing German Victory
            => General Hindenburg + Ludendorff = considered German Heros.
                * More bogging down.
    C) Results: War of Attrition
        1) Western Front - basically just a stalemate. super mega bog
        2) Eastern Front - russian/ germany
        3) Atlantic Front - they try to block out supplies and food.
            A) British Blockade => Surface ships
            B) Germans blockade - Submarines.
                * Unrestricted warfare. Declares the british isles a war zone. Sends out subs to just destroy anything.
            C) US Situation - Most people consider the sub a terrorist weapon. President Wilson will denounce Submarine warfare as uncivilized.
                * America is the main target for the atlantic front. American goods and people are in harms way by both sides.
                * war of 1812 was similar.
                * Lusitania may 1915 was crossing from york to liverpool and was sunk by a sub. 900 die, over 100 who were American, most of which 
                    are women and children. Germans are viewed as murderers as a result.
                * Germany backs off and says they only targets military targets now.


3) Total War - use all of your resources to win, do or die situation. Society is mobilized.
    A) Goal: Complete victory
        * Not just gonna win, but win on YOUR terms. 100% of what is wanted.
    B) MAIN RESOURCES: Human, Cultural, Economic
        * Everyone in society falls into two catagories, either a fighter or a producer.
        * Opens up non military targets as stratagem. 
        * Culturally, "if we lose" they will destroy our way of life.
        * Industry and agriculture is fielded. Have to develop the best transportation: trains and trucks and communications.
            * Tanks are developed. Flame thrower. Poison gas. Airplane bombers.
    C) Wartime Capitalism - Marriage of government and private industry.
        * Result - steady profits, business regulation + increased opportunity.
        * women and minorities are fielded.
