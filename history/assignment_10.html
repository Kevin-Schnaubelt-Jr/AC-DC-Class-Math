    <title>American entering WW1</title>

        &emsp;The main reason for the US entering WWI, not including Germany's mistakes, 
        I think, is British propaganda. What are you supposed to think about the war? We'll, 
        what are your options? Britain, having a monopoly on war news, meant that the goings 
        on of the war were whatever they said it was. The US was fed a steady diet of German 
        atrocities, labeling the Germans as "The Hun." The US was also fed a steady diet of 
        British heroism, and that the British were fighting for freedom. And British news was, 
        of course, in English, which didn't help the Germans much either.

        &emsp;Which brings us to the second main reason, America's strong English roots. The US 
        was founded by the British, and as such many cultural aspects of the US are British. 
        They shared a common language, common religious ideals, and even had a similar legal 
        code. Most of British people, just as most American people, were WASPs, or "White, Anglo, 
        Saxon, Protestants."

        &emsp;The third reason why the US entered the war was that Americans were framing the 
        war, or having it framed for them, as a democracy issue. The allies were made up of 
        democracies with strong powers of representation, while the central powers were still 
        mostly monarchies. The democracies that were there were in their infancy, and still 
        had a lot of power in the hands of those monarchs.
