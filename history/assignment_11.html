    <h1>Huge reparations</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;Germany had to pay an incredible amount of money and resources as recompense for the war.
        The reparations would also be continuous over a long period of time.
    </div>
    <h1>Lost German Territory</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;German had to give up territory that was majority German, including parts of Poland, where many
        leaders were from.
    </div>
    <h1>Permanent Colonial Losses</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;German lost all of it's colonies. This would likely not only remove their 
        their status as a world power, but would hamper their ability to pay reparations.
    </div>
    <h1>Weak Military</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;Germany was only allowed to have a military of 100k soldiers. In addition to this, they could not have tanks (ironic)
        and could only have a 15k man navy with no battleships. Also their air force was barred from using engine power.
        Essentially this would make them completely non competitive. 
    </div>
    <h1>War Guilt Clause</h1>
    <div>
        &emsp;Signing the treaty of Versailles had a clause that put total blame on WW1 onto Germany.
        This coupled with everyone else, would likely seize up the state. But I guess in the end, Germany
        just didn't adhere to any of this anyway, and there was no effective system in place to enforce 
        anything in the treaty.
