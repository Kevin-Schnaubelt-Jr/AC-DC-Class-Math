    Of King Louis the 14th's positive personality traits, I would have to say that his best trait was his public persona.
Being indomitable and cool headed when appearing in public must have been essential in maintaining an image of authority. It was probably his second most important trait,
that of patience, that allowed him to be consistent and diligent in controlling and maintaining his image. His third best trait, his charismatic nature,
seems to the cherry on top of a perfect storm of leaderly bearing, giving no room for doubt as to who was in charge while he was present.
His 4th best trait, I would say, was his observance. Having a keen eye for behavior, or just reading a room in general, certainly must have helped with controlling it.


    Of his worse traits, I would have to say at the top of the list would be his inflexibility.
Failing to adapt, or being unwilling to, means slowing down any work toward solving a problem or reaching a goal.
His second worse trait was likely his demanding nature. Being fearful of a leader is effective in keeping a high standard of performance from subordinates,
but comes with the risk of a degradation of quality overtime, as the goal shifts from performing well to avoiding wraith and reprisal. 
After a demanding nature, his next worst personality trait would have to be his paranoia. Being extremely paranoid that every meal prepared could be poisoned, or that every maid could be a secret assassin, 
can only lead to being hungry all the time and untidy living spaces. And the 4th of his worst personality traits that I've chosen, was his selfishness.
While being selfish seems reasonable for someone in Louis the 14th's position, even a king needs his confidences in order to remain effective.
and being slow to generosity is a poor way to establish loyalty.
