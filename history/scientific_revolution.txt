1) medieval / modern transition-
    * 3 main areas of Changed
    A) political => absolutism / Constitutionalism
    B) Religion => Reformation
    C) intellectual => renaissance / sci. Revolution
    * combined together these produced a new view + approach to living in w. civ.

2) medieval cosmology - about a peoples outlook on the universe.
    A) Christian Theology - medieval Catholicism has monopoly
        1) universe - multiple spheres - each sphere has different laws. 
            A) higher world => heavens - 
            B) lowers world => earth - 
        2) Earth - center of the universe. geocentric outlook.
    B) Greco - Roman Scholarship - from arab and eastern roman sources.
        * subordinate to the bible
        (before 1900 natural philosophy)
        1) aristotle - (384 - 322 BC) - according to him, two essentials. reason and observation. 
            A) Matter - 4 main elements. earth, water, air, fire
            B) Motion - natural state of stuff is to be at rest. "motion is an unnatural action because shit finds its bed and sleeps"
            * a stone falls because it heavier than the air, fire rises because it's "lighter"
        2) ptolemy of alexandria
            * almagest 150 ad - a motionless earth stands at the center of the universe. Says it's the heaviest object. 

3) modern cosmology 
    A) heliocentric theory
    B) mechanical universe - led to a new expanded approach to science. the universe operates upon sophisticated laws on nature. 
        1) mathematical law of nature - a scientific theory that states that motion and space can be measured by time to create more precise scientific
            guiding principles. = use of math to refine common sense observations.

            * direct usage of math formula
            A) plato (427 - 347 bc) - aristotle's teacher. nature truths are universal. need math to figure them out. 
            B) rene descartes (1596 - 1650) - from a french aristocratic family. got a university education. study law in the kingdom of french. catholic. 
            => discourse on the method (1637) - universe is rational and god set it up mathematically. god ultimate mathematician. 
                I think therefore I am.
        2) scientific method - knowledge acquired bt the user of observation and experimentation. = birth of a new scientific culture.
            3 basal assumptions. 
            * creation of sophisticated general laws - knowledge gotten by scientific method is rational and objective. 
            Models of predictability. 
            A) robert Grosseteste (1186 - 1253) - English. highly educated clergy. roman catholic bishop. served as a chancellor at oxford. 
                translating arabic works into Latin. 
            B) francis bacon (1561 - 1626) - english statesmen. philosopher. 
            => "father of modern empiricism"
                empiricism is a theory that states that all knowledge originates from experience. 
                "new atlantis" 1627 - 1662 - royal society founded as an inspiration

4) leading figures -
    A) copernicus - (1473 - 1543) - well educated. background in law, astronomy, philosophy. 
        1) background => polish priest
        2) on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres - life's work. waits until on his deathbed to publish
            (1543) => motion is relative. 
    B) Tycho Brahe - [tico brah] (1546 - 1601) - family made money on shipping tolls. says all planets go around the sun, but the earth is still the center.
        1) background => danish lawyer
        2) most advanced information => finest instruments - develops a observatory.
        * offends danish government and is exiled from denmark. ends up in Prague. before he dies he meets kepler.
    C) Kepler - (1571 - 1630)
        1) background => german protestant minister - father was a professional soldier. - father dies and Kepler goes back to school for math.
            becomes a professor.
        2) Brahe's protege
            abandons Brah's geocentric view after brah dies.
        3) epitome of copernican astronomy - 3 basic laws of planetary motion. elliptical. tracked the cycle of mars. 
            A) planets have oval orbits
            B) planetary orbit speed caries - 
            C) planetary revolutions vary => according to the distance to the sun.
            * all 
    D) Galileo - (1564 - 1642) - born in pizza =]. specializes in physics.
        1) background => Italian doctor
        2) Sidereal messenger - published in (1610) -
            A) heavens are changeable + subject to the same physical laws as the earth.
            B) popularized the telescope - people start going nuts over the thing and build them en masse.
        3) dialogue on the two chief world systems:
            Ptolemaic + copernican (1632)

            A) blasted the geocentric theory + aristotle - attacked aristotle's theory on motion. 
            B) catholic inquisition trouble.

    E) Newton - (1642 - 1727)
        1) background => English math professor - confounders of calculus.
            * cambridge
        2) mathematical principles of natural philosophy (1687)
            * latin name = Principia
            A) atomic structure for Matter
            B) basic laws of motion for Matter
                1) inertia - 
                2) acceleration
                3) cause & effect relationship - for every action there is an equal an opposite reaction. 
            C) gravity - 
        3) grand synthesis of modern cosmology.

# eastern philosophy was irrational and wester was rational.
